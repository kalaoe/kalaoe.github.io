This site is intended to showcase my work as a designer, artist, and developer, blending creativity with clear and functional design. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the project reflects my personal style and dedication to creating visually engaging and personalized user-friendly experiences.

## Inspiration
This portfolio is a work-in-progress, inspired by my love for combining art and computer science. I'm continually exploring ways to improve and enhance the user experience, so stay tuned for updates!
